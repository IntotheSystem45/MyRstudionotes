Give events A and B
Mutually exclusive - No overlap between events A and B e.g. 
Not mutuallay exclusive - There is overlap, the probalbity of both happening isn't 0 

Sample size e.g: S = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)


Proablaites  can only be between 0-1.
0 - 0.2 - veery unlikely
0.2 - 0.4 - unlikley 
0.4 - 0.5 - less likely to happen than not
0.5 - 0.6 - more likely happen than not
0.6 - 0.8 - likely 
0.8 - 1 - Very likely

- Compound events - 
Or - General addition rule
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)


Conugnecy tables:
Find the totals of all rows and columns 
Use the addition rule

Given - P(X|G) = X/G - the given value is the denominator 

Compliments -A^c - the complment of A
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
Examples: P(x < 4), then the comploment is P (>= 4), 

And - General mutliplacaiton rule 
P(A and B) = P(A)P(A|B)

Independant - If the occurnece of 1 event doenst effect the other 
P(A)P(B) - use this for indepedsnt events

Depedant - 
example - P(A) = 3/10 P(B) = 2/9, then P(A and B) = 3/10* 2/9 =

Expected value E(x) = Mean: M1(W1) + M2(W2) + ... + MN(WN) # weifgted mean
